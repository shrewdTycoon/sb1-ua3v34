  "Focus on landing 3-4 key insights rather than overwhelming with data",
  "Structure presentations to build context progressively",

  "Most presentations fail because they lack a clear narrative structure",
  "Every presentation should be anchored in the audience's problem",
  "Transitions are crucial for creating context and maintaining flow"
];

const detailedNotes = `One useful principle of presentation design is: "Don't prove what doesn't need proving."

Time is the most precious resource in most presentations, yet presenters routinely burn that time hammering a point that the audience is already sold on.

Every presentation is ultimately about getting action. We present for a reason, we want people to do something. We present to drive action. 

Whenever our company works with a sales messaging client, we conduct a simple, two - question pulse survey - on a scale from one to ten (ten being stupendous and one being horrible), to assess A) the quality of the core solutions they sell, and B) the quality of the messaging of those same solutions. In other words, how well they are telling their story to the customer.

There's nothing more agonizing than battling to finally get that elusive customer meeting, and then blowing it with a 3.9 out of 10 conversation. Truly, a customer conversation is a terrible thing to waste.

"When you are in the role of customer and the salesperson makes a poor pitch, to what extent does that affect your perception of the underlying value of the product / solution being sold?"

The typical presentation offers too much information, is confusing, illogical, uninteresting, too slide-driven, and too sender-oriented.`;
